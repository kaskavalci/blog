Thunderbird is great! But without your address book it won't be usable. Here are the steps to import your contacts from GMail.

  1. Login to GMail, click on Gmail and choose contacts (left-upper side of gmail).
  2. Click More > Export...
  3. Choose **vCard format**.

vCard is important because coma separated CSV format is not reliable and you may end up with corrupted contacts.

Then,

  1. run Thunderbird, Click on **Address Book**
  2. Tools > Import
  3. Choose **Address Books**
  4. vCard file
  5. Choose GMail's vcard export file.

That's it! All contacts are there, without any conflicts.
