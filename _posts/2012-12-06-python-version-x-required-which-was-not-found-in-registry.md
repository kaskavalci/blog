While installing a plugin to your python you might encounter this error, even though you have a valid python installation. The reason is, you are using 64 bit operating system and unfortunately your plugin is not compatible with 64 bit. Fear not, good guy [Christoph Gohlke](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/) provides 64 bit support for some plugins. Yours could be listed there too. Check out his [website](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs) and hope for the binaries. If you cannot find, there is another method. However you will need some Python knowledge to do it. Here is the [solution](http://tech.valgog.com/2010/01/after-installing-64-bit-windows-7-at.html).
